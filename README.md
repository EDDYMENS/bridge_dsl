## Bridge DSL
Bridge enhances the practise of BizDev by allowing developers expose power witin the apps they build to Business owners

**Advantages**

 * Biz no longer has to wait on Dev for Dashboard implementations to be able to reconfigure parts of their system

 * This level of abstraction allows developers to write code without having to hold all business requirements in their heads.

 * This allows for faster iterations.

 **EG**
You may try out samply code from playground or just run `python playground.py` to execute

**NB**
* This extract has been made possible with permission from `Interpay`
* Current implementation exists for only `python 2.7`
